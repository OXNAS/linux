* Oxford Semiconductor OXNAS NAND Controller

Please refer to nand.txt for generic information regarding MTD NAND bindings.

Required properties:
 - compatible: "oxsemi,ox820-nand"
 - reg: Base address and length for NAND mapped memory.

Optional Properties:
 - clocks: phandle to the NAND gate clock if needed.
 - resets: phandle to the NAND reset control if needed.

Example:

nand: nand@41000000 {
	compatible = "oxsemi,ox820-nand";
	reg = <0x41000000 0x100000>;
	nand-ecc-mode = "soft";
	clocks = <&stdclk CLK_820_NAND>;
	resets = <&reset RESET_NAND>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	status = "disabled";
};
