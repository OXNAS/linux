* Oxford Semiconductor OXNAS DWMAC Ethernet controller

The device inherits all the properties of the dwmac/stmmac devices
described in the file stmmac.txt in the current directory with the
following changes.

Required properties on all platforms:

- compatible:	Depending on the platform this should be one of:
			- "oxsemi,ox820-dwmac"
		Additionally "snps,dwmac" and any applicable more
		detailed version number described in net/stmmac.txt
		should be used.

- reg:	The first register range should be the one of the DWMAC
	controller.

- clocks: Should contain phandles to the following clocks
- clock-names:	Should contain the following:
		- "stmmaceth" - see stmmac.txt
		- "gmac" - peripheral gate clock

- oxsemi,sys-ctrl: a phandle to the system controller syscon node

Example :

etha: ethernet@40400000 {
	compatible = "oxsemi,ox820-dwmac", "snps,dwmac";
	reg = <0x40400000 0x2000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 17 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	interrupt-names = "macirq", "eth_wake_irq";
	mac-address = [000000000000]; /* Filled in by U-Boot */
	phy-mode = "rgmii";

	clocks = <&stdclk CLK_820_ETHA>, <&gmacclk>;
	clock-names = "gmac", "stmmaceth";
	resets = <&reset RESET_MAC>;

	/* Regmap for sys registers */
	oxsemi,sys-ctrl = <&sys>;

	status = "disabled";
};
